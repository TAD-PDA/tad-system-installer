# tad-system-installer
The TAD system installer, meant to be ran on top of a normal raspbian install.

# Usage
- Clone contents of this repository directly into the home folder of the Pi user on a new raspbian install.
- Run install.sh as root

Note that this installs zsh as the default shell for Pi.

If you want to select another shell, install it manually and __copy .zshrc.local to your shell rc__.
